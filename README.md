**A secure, offline desktop password and OTP manager**  

Exforthia is a desktop application designed to securely manage passwords and OTP codes without relying on mobile devices or cloud services. Unlike most authentication solutions that are tied to smartphones, Exforthia provides a **local-first** alternative, ensuring that your sensitive data remains secure and accessible even without an internet connection.  

### **Key Features**  
🔹 **Desktop-First Approach** – Exforthia is built for Windows desktops, offering a more secure and persistent alternative to mobile-based 2FA solutions.  
🔹 **Offline and Local Storage** – All data is stored locally and encrypted, eliminating the risk of cloud-based breaches or online leaks.  
🔹 **Strong Encryption & Obfuscation** – Proprietary encryption methods ensure that even if data is extracted, it remains unreadable without the application.  
🔹 **Windows Hello Integration (Planned)** – Future support for Windows Hello authentication to enhance accessibility while maintaining security.  
🔹 **Intuitive & User-Friendly UI** – Designed for general users, Exforthia aims to provide a visually appealing and easy-to-use experience, unlike more complex alternatives.  
🔹 **Chromium Browser Extension (Planned)** – Allows seamless migration of saved passwords from Chromium-based browsers.  
🔹 **Recovery System** – Users can restore access via a master recovery file with an obfuscated authentication fragment.  

### **Why Exforthia?**  
🔐 **More Secure than Mobile 2FA** – Mobile devices are frequently lost, stolen, or compromised. Exforthia offers a desktop-based alternative that reduces this risk.  
🌍 **Open-Source or Closed-Source?** – The development roadmap includes evaluating whether Exforthia will remain a closed project or be fully open-source.  
📂 **File-Based Syncing** – While future cloud-based services are being considered, Exforthia currently focuses on encrypted file-based synchronization between devices.  

### **Under Development 🚧**  
Exforthia is currently in its early development phase, being structured under the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture with an **Object-Oriented** foundation.  

🚀 Stay tuned for updates and feel free to contribute to the project once it's open for collaboration!
